This is our final computer grapics project
we works acode that draws windmill sample
In this project what we did is modeling windmill.
To do that we have been through some procedures. At the very beginning of our task we used blender open source software to build the textures. 
Then we exported the sketched file with the obj file extension.
After that by importing object loader we were able to connect our exported obj file with openGL.
To do that also we followed some procedure like connecting the vertices
